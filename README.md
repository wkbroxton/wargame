##  General
    Game Instructions:
### Press the Engage! button to start the game. 

>THE DECK
>>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player has their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

>THE PLAY
>>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card adds both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their stack. If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (eight cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, the war status continues until the tie is broken or a player runs out of cards, which would be a loss.

>HOW TO KEEP SCORE
>>The score is kept numerically between the players two decks. The game ends when one player has all 52 cards.

## Next Steps: Planned future enhancements: 

    Icebox Items:
    
* Show cards in War leaving the player's deck and storing in another div.
* A motion background that transitions back and forth from PS Blue and XBox Green.
* A clever way to concede the battle early if the player has had enough.
* A way to select the system you're rooting for/playing as.
* A diagonal line that works in tow with the players Deck count to show the battle in a multifaced way.
